🌱 ShopImpact – Conscious Shopping Dashboard

ShopImpact is a web-based application developed using Python and Streamlit.
The purpose of this project is to help users record their shopping expenses and understand the environmental (CO₂) impact of their purchasing decisions.

The application promotes responsible consumer behavior by combining data tracking, visual analytics, and an eco-scoring system.

🎯 Project Objective

The objectives of this project are to:

Record and organize user shopping data

Estimate carbon emissions based on product categories

Encourage sustainable and environmentally responsible purchasing

Present spending and environmental impact using clear visualizations

Develop a practical application using Python programming concepts

✨ Key Features
📝 Purchase Logging

Users can log purchases by entering:

Product Name

Brand (optional)

Category

Price (₹ INR)

Each purchase automatically calculates an estimated CO₂ footprint.

🌍 Eco Score System

Generates a score between 0 and 100

Based on the ratio of CO₂ emissions to spending

Provides immediate feedback on sustainability

Displayed using a progress bar for clarity

🌿 Eco-Friendly Feedback

Sustainable purchases trigger positive feedback

Higher-impact purchases display suggestions for greener alternatives

Encourages reflection and improvement rather than restriction

📊 Visual Insights

Spending Distribution Chart
Displays how spending is divided across categories

CO₂ Impact Chart
Shows carbon emissions by category

Interactive and color-coded for easy interpretation

📅 Monthly Impact Summary

Summarizes total monthly spending

Displays total monthly CO₂ emissions

Helps track progress over time

🏆 Achievements & Progress

Achievement indicators based on user activity

Eco Score progress bar

Motivates continued responsible behavior

🧪 Testing the Application

The application can be tested by entering sample purchases such as:

Product: Organic Vegetables
Category: Local Food
Price: ₹300

Product: T-Shirt
Category: Eco-Friendly Fashion
Price: ₹1,200

Product: Smartphone
Category: Electronic Goods
Price: ₹18,000

The user can then observe:

Changes in Eco Score

Real-time updates in charts

Updates in the monthly summary table

🤖 Use of AI Tools (Academic Integrity Statement)

During the development of this project, AI tools such as ChatGPT and Veo3 were used in a limited and supportive role for:

Understanding Streamlit functionality and Python concepts

Improving code structure and readability

Refining UI design ideas

Assisting with documentation clarity

All program logic, design decisions, testing, and final implementation were understood, reviewed, and completed by the author.
The project reflects the author’s own learning and application of programming concepts.

📝 Additional Notes

All prices are displayed in ₹ INR

Data is stored only for the active session (no database used)

The application is compatible with Streamlit Community Cloud

No GUI-based libraries (such as tkinter or turtle) are used

Developed for educational and academic purposes
